# Heros of Pymoli - Observations

The data is heavily weighted with male players (84%), who spend $4.07 per purchase on average.  It is noted that female players spent $0.40 more on average than their male counterparts and players that identified as "Other" (or did not disclose their gender) also out-spend them by $0.49 more per person.  Since these two groups only account for 14% and 2% of players respectively, it is unclear whether their higher per average spending would flatten with comparable purchase counts to the male group of players. 

The age range of 20 to 24 was the largest group (44.8%) and accounted for almost half (46.8%) the total revenue.  In fact, this group had at minimum of 229 more purchases than the next two closest groups: 15 to 19 and 25 to 29.  This resulted in $408 more in purchases than those two groups.        

In analysing the most popular items in the game, it appears that players did not gravitate to the highest price items.  Out of the top ten items by purchase count, only one, Nirvana, is among the top ten priciest items.
